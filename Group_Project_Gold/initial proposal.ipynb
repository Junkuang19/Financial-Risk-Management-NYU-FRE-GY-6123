    "# Gold as a Commodity: Drivers, Roles, and Implementable Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Proposal (Group: [Member A], [Member B], [Member C])**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Proposed Topic & Relevance to the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic.** We analyze **gold** through three lenses—**(i) macro drivers**, **(ii) portfolio roles**, and **(iii) implementable strategies**—using spot, futures, and ETF evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance.** The course emphasizes risk, asset allocation, and evidence-based implementation. Gold sits at the intersection of inflation hedging, safe-haven behavior, dollar/real-rate dynamics, and commodity term-structure premia. Our project directly links theory (carry/roll yield, diversification, risk premia) to **replicable, data-driven** methods and deliverables (code, datasets, figures), aligning with rubric criteria on topical relevance, persuasive analysis, and high-quality written/oral presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Proposed Claim / Hypotheses / Arguments & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Thesis (one sentence)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gold’s unconditional buy-and-hold is modest, but a risk-managed approach that is *real-rate–aware* and *term-structure–informed* can materially improve risk-adjusted returns while preserving gold’s diversification during equity stress and inflation surprises.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Research Questions & Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RQ1 – Macro drivers.** What explains time-variation in gold returns?\n",
    "  **H1:** **Real yields** (TIPS) and the **broad USD** dominate; **inflation surprises** and **risk-off proxies** (VIX/MOVE) add state dependence.\n",
    "* **RQ2 – Portfolio role.** How effective is gold as a hedge/safe haven?\n",
    "  **H2:** Gold has **positive convex exposure** to inflation surprises and **negative beta to rising real rates**; safe-haven behavior strengthens in equity drawdowns.\n",
    "* **RQ3 – Implementable strategies.** Can simple rules beat passive exposure after costs?\n",
    "  **H3:** A **curve-carry long/flat** rule with a **real-rate overlay** and **10–12% volatility targeting** outperforms buy-and-hold on Sharpe and max drawdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prices/Returns:** LBMA spot (London PM), COMEX front/next futures to build **constant-maturity** 1- and 3-month series; GLD NAV/flows (shares outstanding).\n",
    "* **Macro factors:** 10y TIPS real yield (DFII10), 3m T-bill, CPI (monthly) with **surprise** = actual − survey/nowcast, USD broad index (DTWEXBGS/DXY proxy), VIX, MOVE.\n",
    "* **Positioning/Flows (robustness):** CFTC COT for gold; GLD flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Decomposition (commodity lens)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decompose futures total return into **spot return + roll/carry (curve) + collateral yield (Rf)**.\n",
    "* Classify **backwardation/contango** regimes; estimate average roll contribution by regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-series regressions** of gold excess returns on Δreal yields, ΔUSD, CPI surprise, ΔVIX/ΔMOVE; rolling betas for regime shifts.\n",
    "2. **Event studies** around CPI/FOMC/UST shocks (±5/10 trading days).\n",
    "3. **Hedge & safe-haven tests:** conditional betas vs S&P 500 and a 60/40; performance in worst equity months (bottom decile).\n",
    "4. **Strategies (out-of-sample discipline):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Curve-carry rule:** Long when carry > threshold/backwardation; otherwise flat/reduced weight.\n",
    "   * **Real-rate overlay:** Scale exposure by –z(Δreal yield, 1–3m).\n",
    "   * **Vol targeting:** Target 10–12% ann. vol; monthly rebalance; include trading costs and realistic rolls.\n",
    "   * **Risk controls:** turnover caps, position bounds, optional drawdown guard.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation metrics:** Ann. return/vol, Sharpe, Sortino, Max DD, skew, **equity/bond betas**, crisis-period performance, turnover & cost impact, **Newey–West t-stats**, subperiod stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation standards**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continuous compounding for rate transforms; explicit roll conventions; reproducible notebooks; slippage/fee sensitivity; train/test split for signals.\n",
    "\n",
