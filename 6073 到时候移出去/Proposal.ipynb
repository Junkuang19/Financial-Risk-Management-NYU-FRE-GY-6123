    "# 📄 NEW DEAL PROPOSAL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to design a contingent **New Deal** transaction that maximizes the total value of **Debt + Equity**, while ensuring that the new investor receives a fair valuation and earns a **present-value profit of $10**. All payments occur at time $T$, and the firm currently has no cash, so the New Deal determines the only inflows/outflows prior to debt maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Baseline Model Without the New Deal\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm follows a Merton-style capital structure with financial distress costs and corporate taxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asset value at maturity: $AT$, lognormally distributed\n",
    "* Face value of debt: $F = 80$\n",
    "* Distress loss: $ZT = \\min(Z, AT)\\mathbf{1}(AT < F)$\n",
    "* Debt payoff: $DT = \\min(AT - ZT, F)$\n",
    "* Equity payoff: $ET = (1-\\tau)(AT - DT - ZT)$\n",
    "* Government taxes: $GT = \\tau(AT - DT - ZT)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this structure, low-asset states generate default and distress costs, reducing the combined value of debt and equity. High-asset states capture upside, but this upside does not fully offset value destroyed in default states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Economic Logic Behind the New Deal\n",
    "\n",
    "A value-maximizing New Deal must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce or eliminate distress costs in low-asset states (large benefit to firm value).\n",
    "2. Provide upside participation to the new investor in high-asset states (so they can earn $+10$ PV).\n",
    "3. Include positive inflows in some outcomes and negative outflows in others, consistent with the assignment instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the New Deal is designed as a state-contingent transfer $NT(AT)$, which adjusts the firm’s effective asset value to $AT + NT$ before applying the waterfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Proposed New Deal Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The New Deal is defined by a single parameter $\\alpha$ that governs how much high-state upside is shared with the investor:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For $AT < F$: $NT(AT) = F - AT$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For $AT \\ge F$: $NT(AT) = -\\alpha (AT - F)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low states ($AT < F$)**\n",
    "  The investor injects exactly enough capital to lift the firm’s asset value to $F$.\n",
    "  ⇒ Default and distress costs $ZT$ drop to zero, and debt is fully repaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High states ($AT \\ge F$)**\n",
    "  The firm shares an $\\alpha$-fraction of the upside above $F$ with the investor.\n",
    "  ⇒ The investor captures meaningful upside, enabling them to earn a $10 PV profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization chooses $\\alpha$ to maximize firm value (Debt + Equity) subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Investor PV $= 10$\n",
    "* And the sign relation: $\\text{Investor PV} = - \\text{NewDeal AveragePV}$ (from the firm’s perspective).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Why This Structure Maximizes Value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value creation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In low states, injections via $NT(AT) = F - AT$ eliminate distress losses $ZT$, which are highly value-destroying.\n",
    "* The firm benefits significantly from removing default and expected bankruptcy costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why upside sharing is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Without upside participation, an investor who only injects capital in bad states would have negative PV.\n",
    "* By sharing a controlled amount of upside ($\\alpha \\in [0,1]$), the investor earns the required $+10$ PV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this structure is efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "* The firm gives up only a small fraction $\\alpha$ of its high-state gains.\n",
    "* In return, it avoids large destruction of value in bad states.\n",
    "* The Solver solution selects the $\\alpha$ that makes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Debt + Equity value as large as possible, while\n",
    "  * Investor PV $= +10$ (i.e., New Deal AveragePV from the firm’s side is $-10$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Resulting Payoff Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "* $NT(AT)$ is **positive** in low states (investor pays the firm).\n",
    "* $NT(AT)$ is **negative** in high states (firm pays investor).\n",
    "* This satisfies the requirement: positive inflows for some outcomes and negative outflows for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting payoff diagram has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A positive “spike” around the default region ($AT$ just below $F$), where the investor strongly supports the firm.\n",
    "* A gently downward-sloping region for high $AT$, where the firm shares upside with the investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed New Deal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eliminates or greatly reduces distress losses in bad states.\n",
    "* Rewards the investor with controlled upside participation in good states.\n",
    "* Maximizes the combined value of **Debt + Equity**.\n",
    "* Ensures the new investor earns a **$10 present-value profit**.\n",
    "* Produces a state-contingent payoff pattern (positive inflows and negative outflows) that exactly matches the assignment requirements.\n",
